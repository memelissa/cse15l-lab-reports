# Lab Report 1
#### Hello! My name is Melissa Phan and in this tutorial, I will be demonstrating how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

1. Installing VScode

 I was able to successfully download the Visual Studio Code (for Mac) from the given website. After installing the program onto my computer, I opened the program, showing the default opening page. 

2. Remotely Connecting

In order to connect to a remote computer, I had to look up my course-specific account for CSE15L, as seen within the first picture. By doing so, we can now verify that we can connect to the SSH host by running the given command in the Terminal: ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu. Using the course-specific account I obtained earlier, I successfully connected my terminal to a remote host. 

3. Trying Some Commands

As seen within the picture, I am running a variety of commands on the remote compter after ssh-ing. For example, the cd command (change directory) is used to change the current working directory and move between different directories. In addition to this, the ls command can be utilized to list files, whereas ls ~a will display all the files including ones that are hidden.
